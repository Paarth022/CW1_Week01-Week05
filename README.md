# CW1 Week01–Week05 Labs 🧠

This repository contains my **Python lab work** for the module **CST1510 – Programming and Algorithms** at *Middlesex University Dubai*.

Each Jupyter Notebook corresponds to a weekly lab session (Weeks 1 to 5) and includes short exercises, tasks, and reflections designed to build core Python skills.
